Annotations files modifications â€“ general: 

extraction_json.py (da anydesk): 

to extract the single annotations and the single pics of each strawberry
Path: 

min_traj_kmeans_all.py: 10 best path kmeans + brut force

a_star_work_all.py: 10 best path generation with A*


Annotations files creation:

adding_z_coordinate.py: add the z coordinates to the json file. NB: the json file is the one with every strawberry

final_annotation_scheduling_allrows.py: take the csv with both the kendall tau and the distance, compute the final cost function and return the 10 best ordered

final_annotation_scheduling.py: take the csv with both the kendal tau and the distance and keep the best one

1)npy_seg_extraction.py: to extract the single .npy for each strawberry

json_unification.py: Add Scheduling Order annotations to the json file (the one with all strawberry)

4) unification_csv.py: unify the csv containing the single coordinate per strawberry and create the files with the coordinates per image 

traj_and_kendal.py: Compute Hardness of Picking cost function and add it to the csv files with the best ten path

adding_centers.py: Add xy centers coordinates to the json file with all the strawberries

associate_coordinates.py (da anydesk): Add coordinates centers to the json files containing information about singles strawberries (to check)

2) xy_center_extraction.py: produce the folder with a  xy center per strawberry in .csv format

3) z_extraction_npy_seg.py produce a folder with the z coordinates, for each strawberry

4) adding_z_to_xy_centers.py add_z to xy centers folder

hop_with_coordinate.py addd hop to csv with coordinates

alpha_tuning.py find the alpha for which the length is the smaller
alpha_tuning_all.py find the alpha for which the mre wrt to the gt is the smaller
